This crate implements a set of tools for building and running Holochain DNA from the command line.

## Install

Our recommended pattern for the installation of `hc` command line tools is to download the binary for your platform from our [releases](https://github.com/holochain/app-spec-rust/releases) page. Otherwise, you can proceed with the more complex instructions for building from source, below.

### Building From Source

These dependencies need to be installed in order to compile, and use `hc`:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
  - needs to be the `nightly` build, so use the following commands, once you have first installed Rust
  - `rustup toolchain install nightly`
  - `rustup default nightly`
  - Also, if you are going to be developing Zomes in Rust, install the WASM build target for Rust, by running:
  - `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly`
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 8 or higher
  - Tests for Holochain apps are now written in Javascript and executed in Nodejs
  - To read further, check out [the holochain-nodejs module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/holochain-nodejs)
- [Zmq](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software)
  - zeromq is a "distributed messaging" software package utilized in the networking stack of Holochain
  - the link above has common platform installation instructions
  - without ZMQ the installation command that follows will fail


To install the latest version of the Holochain command line, run the following command in a terminal
```shell
$ cargo install hc --force --git https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust.git --branch develop
```

The command line tools are now available in your command line using the `hc` command.

Run `hc --version` to confirm.

Run `hc help` for help.

## Usage

`(u)` means the command is not yet implemented.

| Command   | Use                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| init      | Initializes a new Holochain app at the given directory              |
| generate  | Generates a new Zome                                                |
| package   | Builds the current Holochain app into a `.dna.json` file            |
| unpack    | Unpacks a Holochain bundle into its original file system structure  |
| test      | Runs tests written in the test folder                               |
| run       | Starts a websocket server for the current Holochain app             |
| agent (u) | Starts a Holochain node as an agent                                 |

## How To Get Started Building An App

In your terminal, change directories to one where you wish to initialize a new Holochain app.
Run the following, replacing `your_app_name` with your actual app name:
```shell
$ hc init your_app_name
$ cd your_app_name
```

We now have the empty shell of a Holochain app. From here, we will want to generate at least one Zome.
To do this, run the following, replacing `your_zome_name` with a name related to the functionality you wish to develop. For example: `users`.
```shell
$ hc generate zomes/your_zome_name
```

Currently, only Zomes written in Rust can be generated. In the future, you may be able to generate Zomes in another language. `hc generate` scaffolds the files and config you need to get started.

What this did is generate a new folder under `zomes` called `users`. Here is the folder structure of it.
- users
  - code
    - src
      - lib.rs
    - .build
    - Cargo.toml

So in every Zome there must be a `code` folder, which can be compiled into a single `WASM` binary with the code for this Zome.

Now that you have your Rust Zome, check out the two sources of documentation about writing Holochain DNA source code:
1. https://developer.holochain.org/guide/latest
2. https://developer.holochain.org/api/latest/hdk

In order for Holochain to run your app, you have to build your code into a single packaged file. Those instructions follow.

## What are .dna.json files?

Holochain DNA can be fully contained in a file known as a `.dna.json` file.
It is a JSON file, with a particular structure that Holochain can understand, and execute.

This is an unusual JSON file; it is part configuration, and part executable.

The configuration part comes from the `json` file at the top level of your source code.

The executable part comes from having embedded Base64 encoded WebAssembly code in the file. *What does that mean?* [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) is a fast and secure low-level language.
Rather than storing the code in its ugly raw WASM bytecode format, Holochain expects the code to be [encoded using Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) , for legibility and simplicity reasons.

If you haven't heard of WebAssembly (WASM for short), that's ok. Important to know is that WASM is intended as a "compilation target" for other languages, not a language to write code in. So instead of writing code in WASM, write code in a language that's familiar to you, and [supports WASM](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs). When it's time to run your code in Holochain, compile it.

In order to avoid having to handcraft this complex JSON structure, with lots of room for error, the `hc package` command streamlines the process of taking your "raw" application folder, and packaging it up into the final `.dna.json` file.

More information about this follows.

## Using Built-in Compilation

The `hc package` tool will automate the process of compiling your Zome code, encoding it, and inserting into the `.dna.json` file. In order to get these benefits, you just need to make sure that you have the right compilation tools installed on the machine you are using the command line tools from, and that you have the proper configuration files in your Zome folders.

`hc package` works with two special files called `.hcignore` files and `.build` files.

### .build files
In the process of building a `.dna.json` file, here is what Holochain does.
- It iterates Zome by Zome adding them to the JSON
- For each Zome, it looks for any folders containing a `.build` file
- For any folder with a `.build` file, it executes one or more commands from the `.build` file to create a WASM file
- It takes that built WASM file and Base64 encodes it, then stores a key/value pair for the Zome with the key as the folder name and the encoded WASM as the value

When using `hc generate` to scaffold a Zome, you will have a `.build` file automatically. If you create your Zome manually however, you will need to create the file yourself. Here's the structure of a `.build` file, using a Rust Zome which builds using Cargo as an example:
```json
{
  "steps": {
    "cargo": [
      "build",
      "--release",
      "--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown"
    ]
  },
  "artifact": "/tmp/holochain/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/code.wasm"
}
```

The two top level properties are `steps` and `artifact`. `steps` is a list of commands which will be sequentially executed to build a WASM file. `artifact` is the expected path to the built WASM file. Under `steps`, each key refers to the bin of the command that will be executed, such as `cargo`. The value of `cargo`, the command, is an array of arguments: `build`, and the two `--` flags. In order to determine what should go here, just try running the commands yourself from a terminal, while in the directory of the Zome code.

### Ignoring using .hcignore files

Sometimes, you'll want to exclude files and folders in your project directory to get a straight `.dna.json` file that can be understood by Holochain. In order to do that, just create a `.hcignore` file. It has a similar structure to `.gitignore` files:

```
README.md
dist
.DS_Store
```

The `package` command includes patterns inside `.gitignore` files automatically, so you don't have to write everything twice. Also *hidden* files are ignored by default as well.

### Rust -> WASM compilation tools
If we take Zome code in Rust as an example, you will need Rust and Cargo set up appropriately to build WASM from Rust code. WASM compilation is available on the `nightly` Rust toolchain. To enable it, run the following:
```shell
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly # adds WASM as a compilation target
$ rustup override set nightly # switch to the nightly rust toolchain for the current project directory
```

Once that's done, you should be able to run commands like `cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown` and have it work.

Once all of this is set up, you can build and run your `.dna.json` file with Holochain!

### Writing and Running Tests
By default, when you use `hc init` to create a new project folder, it creates a sub-directory called `test`. The files in that folder are equipped for testing your project.

Once you have a project folder initiated, you can run `hc test` to execute your tests. This combines the following steps:
  1. Packaging your files into a DNA file, located at `dist/bundle.json`. This step will fail if your packaging step fails.
  2. Installing build and testing dependencies, if they're not installed (`npm install`)
  4. Executing (with [holochain-nodejs](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-nodejs)) the test file found at `test/index.js`

`hc test` also has some configurable options.

If you want to run it without repackaging the DNA, run it with
```shell
hc test --skip-package
```

If your tests are in a different folder than `test`, run it with
```shell
hc test --dir tests
```
 where `tests` is the name of the folder.

If the file you wish to actually execute is somewhere besides `test/index.js` then run it with
```shell
hc test --testfile test/test.js
```
where `test/test.js` is the path of the file.

You have the flexibility to write tests in quite a variety of ways, open to you to explore.

## Running your application
For the purpose of *testing* APIs or prototyping user interfaces, you can run a DNA from the directory it's contained. The most basic way to do this is to run:
```shell
hc run
```
This will start the application and open a WebSocket on port `8888`.

There are three option flags for `hc run`.

If you wish to customize the port number that the WebSocket runs over, then run it with a `-p`/`--port` option, like:
```shell
hc run --port 3400
```

If you wish to "package" your DNA before running it, which is to build the `bundle.json` file from the source files, then use the `-b`/`--package` option, like:
```shell
hc run --package
```
Note that `hc run` always looks for a `bundle.json` file in the root of your app folder, so make sure that one exists there when trying to use it. `hc run --package` will do this, or run `hc package` and then move `dist/bundle.json` into the root.

By default, none of the data your application is writing to the source chain gets persisted. If you wish to persist data onto the file system, use the `--persist` flag, like:
```shell
hc run --persist
```
This will store data in the same directory as your app, in a hidden folder called `.hc`.

Of course these options can be used in combination with one another.
